If no `can_replace_on` field is specified, the `place_block` block can be placed on any existing block.\nThis feature will also try to spread the 'place_block' block around the location in world the feature is placed.\nSucceeds if: At least one block is successfully placed.\nFails if: All block placements fail.",
